### 5. Final Feedback

<p>
Awesome project Yolie! I thought you did a great job with the app. I've seen you're front end skills, and I know you could have made a more visually appeasing app, provided you had the time. I'm glad you were able to knock out the CRUD operations, thus having all of the functionality already finished, before going back to teh front end. Don't forget to study so you don't loose your edge.
